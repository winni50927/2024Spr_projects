#### Abstract:

Rummikub is a classic board game whose invention can be traced back to the time after World War II. The game has 106 tiles, including 2 sets of 1 - 13 in four colors and 2 wildcards. Each player will be randomly assigned 14 tiles initially, and the rule of the game requires players to use their own tiles or combine their tiles with public melds to create melds formed as runs (e.g. 5, 6, 7) or groups (e.g. 7, 7, 7) with at least 3 components. All melds created will become public melds that can be used by all players. If players cannot create any melds in their rounds, they need to draw a new tile. The winner is the first one to get rid of all of his or her tiles. 

In the final project, I plan to develop a Type II project, utilizing Monte Carlo Simulation to test the hypotheses, to determine those strategies or competence that can actually attribute to a higher probability of winning Rummikub games.



#### Hypothesis:

1. The Player who is the first to pass the first-move limit (must play one or multiple sets with a total value of at least 30 points.) has a higher probability of winning. 

2. Players employ selective strategies have a higher probability of winning. 

3. Players with the competence to reorganize more existing sets into new sets and runs are more likely to win.
